=============

Page Tree Hierarchy Helper for Concrete5 - Scan page ancestors for attributes and areas.


NOTICE
======
This has been upload to github due to requests from people for the code.
It has not been tested since C5 5.4.1.1.  There is no reason it shouldn't work still - I just
haven't had time to test it.
